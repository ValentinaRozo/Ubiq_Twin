## Project Overview

This project investigates how gaze direction can serve as an indicator of attention in different environments. This repository focuses on virtual reality (VR), where a virtual environment was developed in Unity using the **[Ubiq](https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq)** package to enable multi-user connectivity and networked interaction between participants. The study is part of a broader investigation that also includes face-to-face and telepresence environments.

### Main Objective

The main goal of the project is to analyze how head orientation and gaze direction can reflect participants' level of attention within a virtual reality environment, enabling new ways to assess interaction in virtual spaces.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of several technologies to create an immersive virtual reality experience:

- **Virtual Environment Developed in Unity**: The virtual reality space was created with Unity, using the **[Ubiq](https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq)**, package, which facilitates multi-user connectivity and network interaction among participants.
- **3D Model (Digital Twin)**: e 3D model used in the project is a digital twin retrieved from the **[ColivriDigitalTwin](https://github.com/imagine-uniandes/ColivriDigitalTwin)**, repository, representing an interactive space within the virtual environment.
- **Oculus Quest 2**: The project is designed to run on the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset, providing an immersive and natural interaction experience within the virtual environment.

## Virtual Reality

In the virtual reality phase, participants interact within a virtual environment using the **Oculus Quest 2**. Gaze direction is measured and analyzed, taking into account the visual field limitations of the device. During testing, participants mainly focus on the visible elements in their environment, allowing researchers to study how objects within the field of view affect attention during interaction.

### Key Observations
- **Influence of the visual field**: Gaze direction is influenced by the physical limitations of the Oculus Quest 2, leading participants to focus on directly visible objects.
- **Visual attention**: Gaze direction analysis is used as a metric to evaluate the distribution of participants' attention in the virtual environment.
  
## Requirements
- **Unity 2022.3.16f1**: Recommended version of Unity.
- **Git LFS**: Git Large File Storage must be configured to handle large files such as 3D models.
- **Oculus Quest 2:** Properly configured and linked to your machine for virtual reality testing.
